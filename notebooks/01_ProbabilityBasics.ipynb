    "# Introduction to Probability with Python\n",
    "Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood or chance of different outcomes. It is fundamental in various fields such as statistics, machine learning, data science, and epidemiology. This guide provides an introduction to probability concepts using Python, demonstrating how to perform basic probability operations and simulations.\n"

    "3. **Event**: A subset of the sample space, representing a specific outcome or combination of outcomes.\n",

    "6. **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.\n"
